I am currently working in the Emerging Technologies team in PwC US Advisory. The team focuses primarily on providing innovative, cutting edge solutions to client problems leveraging AI, ML and IoT. In addition to client projects, we also build PoCs (Proof of Concepts) for different technologies which we think will bring value to clients and present them as potential replacements for outdated ways of working.

Before this, I did my Masters and Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I was interested in Simulation studies and did multiple projects in this domain including molecular dynamics simulations, simulating flows of particles and simulating burner profiles. All of this was built leveraging multiple open source packages and products along with self written optimised code.

Apart from this, I like board games, online strategy games and geeky tech stuff. I also like teaching and have been pursuing several opportunities to teach underprivileged students. I love keeping up with the latest trends in technology both in the hardware and the software domain.
