<span style="font-style:bold;font-size:120%"><a class="mt-1">AIM</a></span>

The aim of this project was to consolidate the different trainings held in the firm for the last 3-4 years and generate a searchable dashboard with relevant information.

<span style="font-style:bold;font-size:120%"><a class="mt-1">DETAILS</a></span>

The consolidation and standardisation for all the trainings was done by scraping information from mails and other portals and arranging them in google drive based on the scraping output. A live tableau dashboard was then generated from the index sheet and deployed on a central platform that everyone in the firm can access. Apart from keyword search, multiple filters were also included in the dashboard.

<span style="font-style:bold;font-size:120%"><a class="mt-1">IMPACT</a></span>

This dashboard allowed people in the firm to search for past trainings with feedback and help plan future trainings based on that. Also, several hours were saved allowing people to re-use decks and other material from past trainings. This also helped foster an environment of self-learning within the firm as one can just search and get all the material relevant for a particular topic in just seconds.
