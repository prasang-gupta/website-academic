The aim of this project was to build out a fully functional proof of concept for the fingervein detection biometric system. This end-to-end system would include a frontend for new user registration, verification of user fingervein and deletion.

<span style="font-style:bold;font-size:120%"><a class="mt-1">DETAILS</a></span>

We achieved this using a Fingervein device and a custom built secure backend database. All the services were defined as part of an API which was hosted on a cloud platform. All the information transfer was done after using encryption. Furthermore, the frontend was built as a Google Chrome extension and integrated right into the browser for easy usage. This would ensure scalability and hassle free adoption.

<span style="font-style:bold;font-size:120%"><a class="mt-1">IMPACT</a></span>

We were able to test out the full end-to-end pipeline right from registering new users and other management options provided to actually verifying the users based on the fingervein scans. This capability was built out and documented to be used for any future client engagements as a replacement for the traditional fingerprint security system.
