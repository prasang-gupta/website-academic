      I worked as an intern for 2 months at TRDDC Pune. As in intern, I was tasked with exploring macroscopic model of skinâ€™s upper layer stratum corneum using OpenFoam. This open source package was being used for the first time in the research facility.\

      I completed the work well within the time frame and had time to complete an extension of the original problem statement as well. I was awarded an 'Excellent' grade for the internship for immaculate coding skills and dedication to work.
