I worked as an Academic Mentor in the Counselling Service Team in my sophomore year and taught :
- [ESC 101 : Fundamentals of Computing](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/esc101.html)

having scored an A* (for exemplary performance) in the course. 

I also served as a member of the [Overall Academics Team]() in my junior year and as [Overall Coordinator]() of the [Counselling Service](https://www.iitk.ac.in/counsel/index.php) in my senior year, responsible for the functioning and management of the student-run body. My responsibilies included managing teams comprising of a total of 200 students at different levels, managing funds, coming up with campus-wise sessions, and organising the Orientation program for freshmen.

I also served as a TA (Teaching Assistant) in 2 courses as a masters student. The courses were :

- [CHE 352A : Chemical Process Simulation Lab](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~vagarwal/doc/che352A.pdf) *with [Prof. Vishal Aggarwal](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~vagarwal/about.html)*
- [CHE 492A : Unit Operations Laboratory](https://iitk.ac.in/new/che391a) *with [Prof. Anurag Tripathi](https://www.iitk.ac.in/che/at.htm)*

I also taught pre-college maths and science to underprivileged students in the neighbouring village of Kanpur in my freshman and sophomore year. I currently am teaching a group of underprivileged students and helping them prepare for IIT-JEE entrance exam.
